# Contribution Program

The Contributors program recognizes the efforts made by individual contributors, as well as the companies that enable them to do so.

The program tracks the contributions made across the VueStorefront and Storefront UI projects both in the form of code, documentation, as well as answered questions, conference presentations given, blog articles written, and any other public efforts. 
This allows also non-technical contributors to enter the program.

Submit your contributions via [https://forms.gle/qM8tGuvsNxxahMdK6](https://forms.gle/qM8tGuvsNxxahMdK6).

## Points and rewards
Every 3 months all contributors start with a clean slate. Through contributions, points are gained resulting in a scoreboard. The top 25 contributors receive a star as well as getting access to the Contributor Access program the following month.
Each month the score resets, giving all participants equal chance in the program.

The points will differ based on the effort.

- Approved PR - 10, 30 or 100 points depending on size
- Approved documentation contribution - 10, 30 or 100 points
- Accepted forum answer - 10 points
- Conference or Meetup presentation - 50, 100 or 300 points - a meetup has to be open for public to atend so it cannot be a company internal event, slides and possibly a recording have to be shared online 
- Blog post written - 50 points

Please be aware attribution of points is subject to the VSF Community teams judgement.

## Cashing in Points
At the end of the 3 month term points can be cashed in for goodies like t-shirts, stickers and other swag.

## Contributor Access
The top 30 active contributors enter the Contributor Access program for the following term. This means they can attend the VSF team AMA which is an online, asynchronous format where we answer questions not directly related to code or bugs, but more high over topics.

Most importantly, the contributors get access to the backlog. By voting and commenting they get a direct say in the future of the project. 
A platform will be in place to streamline this. Contributor access gives direct influence on the future of the projects.

## Sponsor Recognition
Top Contributors can decide to put forward their employer for the Sponsor Recognition. Here we give exposure to employers that enable their employees to participate in the contribution program during office hours,  as well as giving them a seat at the table when it comes to the future of the platform through votes for the backlog / invites for backlog calls.
